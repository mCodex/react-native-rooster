# React-Native-Rooster üêî

An elegant Toast solution for react-native apps. It works on Android and iOS platforms.

![Demo](./demo.gif)

**NOTE: This is a WIP it is not available for production yet!**

## Motivation

I've been working on React-Native projects for a long time and I use toast very often, but I still haven't found a library that is flexible enough for handling toasts. So, I decided to work on this to build a flexbible and function Toast library something powerful like [react-toastify](https://github.com/fkhadra/react-toastify)


## Features

- [x] Automatically keyboard listener. If keyboard is open the toast will not be hidden by it

- [ ] Support for different types of toasts (success, info, warning)
- [ ] Support for different positions (top, center, top-left, top-right and so on...)
- [ ] Support for icons
- [ ] Support for multiple toasts being shown at the same time
- [ ] Support for toasts be used inside regular functions not only components' functions

Have more ideas? Put it here!

## Contributing

You can clone this repository and just run:

```bash
yarn localPublish
```

After that, you can run the example project inside [examples](./examples)

### Changing Toast's code

Every change you do in the Toast component you must run again:

```bash
yarn localPublish
```

It will release a new Toast's local version and install it automatically in the example project
