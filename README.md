# React-Native-Rooster üêî

An elegant Toast solution for react-native apps. Built using Typescript, hooks, contexts and providers. It works on Android and iOS platforms

![Demo](./demo.gif)

**NOTE: This is a WIP it is not available for production yet!**

## üåü Motivation

I've been working on React-Native projects for a long time and I use toast very often, but I still haven't found a library that is flexible enough for handling toasts. So, I decided to work on this to build a flexible and functional Toast library powerful like [react-toastify](https://github.com/fkhadra/react-toastify)


## üõ† Features

- [x] Automatically keyboard listener. If keyboard is open the toast will not be hidden by it

- [ ] Support for different types of toasts (success, info, warning)
- [ ] Support for different positions (top, center, top-left, top-right and so on...)
- [ ] Support for icons
- [ ] Support for multiple toasts being shown at the same time
- [ ] Support for toasts be used inside regular functions not only components' functions

Have more ideas? Put it here!

## How it works

First, you need to import and wrap your application within ToastProvider:

```javascript
import { ToastProvider } from 'react-native-rooster';

<ToastProvider>
    {...}
</ToastProvider>
```

Now you can use our hooks to show your toasts:

```javascript
import { useToast } from 'react-native-rooster';

addToast({
  type?: 'success' | 'error' | 'info',
  title: string,
  message?: string
})
```

## API

### ToastProvider

It is the provider which controls displaying new toasts

### addToast({ type?: 'success' | 'error' | 'info', title: string, message?: string })

Will show a new toast based on given parameters. Also, it will automatically disappear after 3 seconds on the screen.

### removeToast()

Removes the last toast from screen.

## ü§ù Contributing

You can clone this repository and just run:

```bash
yarn localPublish
```

After that, you can run the example project inside [example](./example)

### Changing Toast's code

Every change you do in the Toast component you must run again:

```bash
yarn localPublish
```

It will release a new Toast's local version and install it automatically in the example project
